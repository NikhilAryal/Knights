# Knights
Knights is a game also known as knights and knaves. 

The objective of the puzzle is, given a set of sentences spoken by each of the characters, determine, for each character, 
whether that character is a knight or a knave.

In a Knights and Knaves puzzle, the following information is given: Each character is either a knight or a knave. A knight will always 
tell the truth: if knight states a sentence, then that sentence is true. Conversely, a knave will always lie: if a knave states a 
sentence, then that sentence is false.
